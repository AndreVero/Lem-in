# Lem-in

• This project's purpose is to find the shortest way to get ants from the Start point of the ant nest to the end point.

• Obviously, their is some contraints : the ants have to take the shortest way, can't walk on the other ants and two or more ants can't be at the same place at the same time.

• At the beginning, the ants are in the room indicated by the ##start command. They have to reach the ##end room in the shortest way possible.

• Only the moving ants are displayed

• Every turn, one ant is moved to a room linked to where she was at the previous turn.

• The results are displayed in this way : ant_number rooms name and position Links between the rooms Lx-y Lz-w Lr-o ... Where x, z, r are the ants number (from 1 to ant_number) and y, w, o rooms names.
